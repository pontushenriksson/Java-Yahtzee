- First commit with all of the dependencies and no other code.

> Oct 14, 2022

- Moved the read.me file to the root folder, fixed spelling errors in the read.me file, removed some unneeded dependencies, made the ones combination array, put all of the current dices in an array and added re-roll availability.
  **Errors: The program only works 20% of the time, it receives an "Index 6 out of bounds for length 6" error**

- Fixed the old "Index 6 out of bounds for length 6" error and the program will now work 100% of the time by removing the +1 by the randomizer and changed the maount of dices from 6 to the actual 5 dices, added the devlog.md
  **Errors:** - **~~The program only works 20% of the time, it receives an "Index 6 out of bounds for length 6" error~~** - **Can't print the currentArray outside the loop**
